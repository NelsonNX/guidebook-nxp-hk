# Scrum

1. Roles

    - product owner
    - development team
    - scrum master

2. Artifacts

    - Product Backlog
    - Sprint Backlog
    - Increment

3. 5 (+1) Events in Scrum
    
    - Sprint - Programming
    - Sprint Planning - Meeting
    - Daily Scrum - Standup
    - Sprint Review - Meeting
    - Sprint Retrospectives - Meeting

    - (Refinement)

2. Differences between Scrum vs Waterfall

    a. Scrum
    
    - Fixed Timeboxing
    - Controllable Scope OR Resources
    => Give up non-core features


    b. Waterfall

    - Fixed Scope
    - Controllable Resouces OR Time
    => Delay

3. [Definition of Done (DoD)](https://www.productplan.com/learn/agile-definition-of-done/#:~:text=Defining%20the%20definition%20of%20done,progress%E2%80%9D%20to%20%E2%80%9Cdone.%E2%80%9D)

    - Code is peer-reviewed
    - Code is checked in
    - Code is deployed to test environment
    - Code/feature passes regression testing
    - Code/feature passes smoke testing
    - Code is documented
    - Help documentation is updated
    - Feature is OKâ€™d by stakeholders

4. Make sure there is a story point of each task

    `Fibonacci number` will be a [good](https://www.mountaingoatsoftware.com/blog/why-the-fibonacci-sequence-works-well-for-estimating) tool to follow:

    We decide the number of story points based on the followings:

    1. the complexity
    2. the time to spend
    3. the testing effort on `developer`

    The meaning of each number

    - 1 (very easy, can be done in less than 1 hour)
    - 2 (easy, but need time to implement and verify, maybe need to spend 1 to several hours)
    - 3 (medium, expected to spend around 1 day to finish it)
    - 5 (complicated, expected days)
    - 8 (very complicated, expected a week)
    - 13 (it will be super huge at an idea that we cannot imagine, even cant estiamte the timeline)

    We need to break down the task into several one if the task has more than 8 story points

    There is also a possibility that the task has regarded as `spike`. Which means we do not have any ideas how it is going to implement.
